# Ziffer Projekt Archive
The [Ziffer Projekt Archive]("http://ziffer.chienius.com") site reimagined.

## Introduction
This is an experiment on Node.js, Grunt, Jade, Stylus, Angular.js, etc.. May contain code of poor quality.
Since most links on [the orginal Ziffer Projekt Archive]("http://home.chienius.com/ziffer") was unreachable, the new site is a replacement to that one.

## Build Guide
```
npm install
````

Make sure that your grunt is globally installed and then
```
grunt build
```
Files will be built in `./build` directory.

You can also start a development environment stacked with a simple web server by
```
grunt dev
```

You may need to clean the workspace after each build by
```
grunt clean
```
